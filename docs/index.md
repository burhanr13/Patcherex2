This site contains the documentation for the Patcherex2 project, a tool for patching binaries.

Patcherex2 is a rewritten adaptation of the original Patcherex project, aimed at building upon its core ideas and extending its capabilities. It attempts to be a comprehensive and reliable replacement for other patching tools, allowing for patching at the byte, data, instruction, and function level, as well as allowing others to easily implement additional architectures.
